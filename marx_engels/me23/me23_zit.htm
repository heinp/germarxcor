"Desire implies want; it is the appetite of the mind, and as natural as hunger to the body ... the greatest number (of things) have their value from supplying the wants of the mind."

"The natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniences of human life." (John Locke, "Some Considerations on the Consequences of the lowering of Interest", 1691, in "Works", edit. Lond. 1777, v. II, p. 28.)</P>

"Tutti i fenomeni dell' universo, sieno essi prodotti della mano dell'uomo, ovvero delle universali leggi della fisica, non ci danno idea di attuale creazione, ma unicamente di una modificazione della materia. Accostare e separare sono gli unici elementi che l'ingegno umano ritrova analizzando l'idea della riproduzione; e tanto &egrave; riproduzione di valores" (...) "e di ricchezza se la terra, l'aria e l'acqua ne' campi si trasmutino in grano, come se colla mano dell' uomo il glutine di un insetto si trasmuti in velluto ovvero alcuni pezzetti di metallo si organizzino a formare una ripetizione.

<P>S. 61, Note 16<BR>
"One man has employed himself a week in providing this necessary of life ... and he that gives him some other in exchange, cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent, than by computing what cost him just as much labour and time: which in effect is no more than exchanging one man's labour in one thing for a time certain, for another man's labour in another thing for the same time." ("Some Thoughts on the Interest of Money in general etc,", p. 39.)</P>
<P>S. 64, Note 17<BR>

<P>S. 77, Note 23<BR>
"The value of any commodity denoting its relation in exchange, we may speak of it as ... corn-value, cloth-value, according to the commodity with which it is compared; and then there are a thousand different kinds of value, as many kinds of value as there are commodities in existence, and all are equally real and equally nominal." ([S. Bailey,] "A Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measures, and Causes of Value; chiefly in reference to the writings of Mr. Ricardo and his followers. By the Author of Essays on the Formation etc. of Opinions", London 1825, p. 39.)</P>
<P>S. 94, Note 31<BR>
"As it is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches, the employment of those faculties, labour of some kind, is our original treasure, and it is always from this employment - that all those things are created which we call riches ... It is certain too, that all those things only represent the labour which has created them, and if they have a value, or even two distinct values, they can only derive them from that (the value) of the labour from which they emanate. (Ricardo, "The principles of Pol. Econ.", 3. ed.. Lond. 1821, p. 334.)</P>
<P>S. 96, Note 33<BR>
"Les &eacute;conomistes ont une singuli&egrave;re mani&egrave;re de proc&eacute;der. Il n'y a pour eux que deux sortes d'institutions, celles de l'art et celles de la nature. Les institutions de la f&eacute;odalit&eacute; sont des institutions artificielles, celles de la bourgeoisie sont des institutions naturelles. Ils ressemblent an ceci aux th&eacute;ologiens, qui eux aussi &eacute;tablissent deux sortes de religions. Toute religion qui n'est pas la leur est une invention des hommes, tandis que leur propre religion est une &eacute;manation de dieu. - Ainsi il y a au de l'histoire, mais il n'y en a plus."

Clement,] "A Discourse of the General Notions of Money, Trade, and Exchange, as they stand in relations to each other. By a Merchant", Lond. 1695, p. 7.)</P>
<P>"Silver and gold, coined or uncoined, tho' they are used for a measure of all other things, are no less a commodity than wine, oyl, tobacco, cloth or stuffs." ([J. Child,] "A Discourse concerning Trade, and that in particular of the East-Indies etc,", London 1689, p. 2.)</P>

"If a man can bring to London an ounce of silver out of the earth in Peru, in the same time that he can produce a bushel of corn, then one is the natural price of the other; now if by reason of new and more easie mines a man can procure two ounces of silver as easily as he formerly did one, the corn will ha as cheap at 10 shillings the bushel, as it was before at 5 shillings, caeteris partibus."

"In this case" (...) " ... they licked it" (the thing represented to them) "twice to their tongues, after which they seemed to consider the bargain satisfactorily concluded."</P>
<P>S. 112, Note 54<BR>
"Our coinage was originally adapted to the employment of silver only - hence an ounce of silver can always ha divided into a certain adequate number of pieces of coin; but as gold was introduced at a later period into a coinage adapted only to silver, an ounce of gold cannot be coined into an adequate number of pieces." (Maclaren, "History of the Currency", London 1858, p. 16.)</P>

<P>S. 134f., Note 77<BR>
"Money being ... the common measure of buying and selling, every body who has anything to sell, and cannot procure chapmen for it, is presently apt to think, that want of money in the kingdom, or country, is the cause why his goods do not go off; and so, want of money is the common cry; which is a great mistake ... What do these people want, who cry out for money? ... The Farmer complains ... he thinks that were more money in the country, he should have a price for his goods ... Then it seems money is not his want, but a Price for his corn and cattle, which he would sell, but cannot ... why cannot he get a price? ... 1) Either there is too much corn and cattle in the country, so that most who come to market have need of selling, as he has, and few of buying or. 2) There wants the usual vent abroad by Transportation ... Or, 3) The consumption fails, as when men, by reason of poverty, do not spend so much in their houses as formerly they did, wherefore it is not the increas of specifick money, which would at all advance the farmer's goods, but the removal of any of these three causes, which do truly keep down the market ... The merchant and shopkeeper want money in the same manner, that is, they want a vent for the goods they deal in, by reason that the markets fail ... a nation never thrives better, than when riches are tost from hand to hand." (Sir Dudley North, "Discourses upon Trade", Lond. 1691, p. 11-15 passim.)</P>
<P>S. 136f., Note 78<BR>
"There is a certain measure, and proportion of money requisite to drive the trade of a nation, more or leas than which, would prejudice the same. Just as there is a certain proportion of farthings necessary in a small retail Trade, to change silver money, and to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest silver pieces ... Now as the proportion of the number of farthings requisite in commerce is to be taken from the number of people, the frequency of their exchanges, as also, and principally, from the value of the smallest silver pieces of money; so in like manner, the proportion of money (gold and silver specie) requisite to our trade, is to be likewise taken from the frequency of commutations, and from the bigness of payments." (William Petty, "A Treatise on Taxes and Contributions", Lond. 1667, p. 17.)</P>
<P>"The quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to bc circulated by it i.. The value of goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper consumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never admits any more, ([A. Smith] "Wealth of Nations", [vol. III,] I. IV, ch. I. [p. 87, 89.])</P>
<P>S.137, Note 79<BR>
"The prices of things will certainly rise in every nation, as the gold and silver increase amongst the people; and, consequently, where the gold and silver decrease in any nation, the, prices of all things must fall proportionably, to such decrease of money." (Jacob Vanderlint, "Money answers all Things", Lond., 1734, p. 5.)</P>
<P>"No inconvenience can arise by an unrestrained trade, but very great advantage; since, if the cash of the nation be decreased by it, which prohibitions are designed to prevent, those nations that get the cash will certainly find every thing advance in price, as the cash increases amongst them. And ... our manufactures and every thing else, will soon become so moderate as to turn the balance of trade in our favour, and thereby fetch the money back again." (l.c.p. 43, 34.)</P>
<P>S. 138f., Note 80<BR>
"Si l'on compare la masse de l'or et de l'argent qui est dans le monde, avec la somme des marchandises qui y sont, il est certain que chaque denr&eacute;e ou marchandise, en particulier, pourra &ecirc;tre compar&eacute;e &agrave; une certaine portion [...] de l'autre. Supposons qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule denr&eacute;e ou marchandise dans le monde, ou qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule qui s'ach&egrave;te, et qu'elle se divise comme l'argent; cette partie de cette marchandise r&eacute;pondra &agrave; une partie de la masse de l'argent; la moiti&eacute; du total de l'une &agrave; la moiti&eacute; du total de l'autre etc., ... l'&eacute;tablissement du prix des choses d&eacute;pend toujours fondamentalement de la raison du total des choses au total des signes." (Montesquieu, l.c., t. III, p. 12, 13.)</P>
<P>"Mankind having consented to put an imaginary value upon gold and silver ... the intrinsic value, regarded in these metals, [...] is nothing but the quantity." ([J. Locke,] "Some Considerations etc.", 1691, "Works", ed. 1777, vol. II, p. 15.)</P>
<P>S. 139, Note 8<BR>
"Silver and gold, like other commodities, have their ebbings and flowings. Upon the arrival of quantities from Spain ..... is carried into the Tower, and coined. Not long after there will come a demand for bullion, to be exported again. If there is none, but all happens to be in coin, what then? Melt it down again; there's no loss in it, for the coining costs the owner nothing. Thus the nation has been abused, and made to pay for the twisting of straw, for asses to eat. If the merchant" (...) "had to pay the price of the coinage, he would not have sent his silver to the Tower without consideration; and coined money always keep a value above uncoined silver." (North, l.c.p. 18.)</P>
<P>S. 140, Note 82<BR>
"If silver never exceed what is wanted for the smaller payments, it cannot be collected in sufficient quantities for the larger payments ... the use of gold in the main payments necessarily implies also its use in the retail trade: those who have gold coin, offering them for small purchases, and receiving with the commodity purchased a balance of silver in return; by which means the surplus of silver that would otherwise encumber the retail dealer, is drawn off and dispersed into general circulation. But if there is as much silver as will transact the small payments independent of gold, the retail dealer must then receive silver for small purchases; and it must of necessity accumulate in his hands." (David Buchanan, "Inquiry into the Taxation and Commercial Policy of Great Britain", Edinburgh 1844, p. 248, 249.)</P>
<P>S. 142, Note 84<BR>
"That, as far as concerns our domestic exchanges, all the monetary functions which are usually performed by gold and silver coins, may ha performed as effectually by a circulation of inconvertible notes, having no value but that factitious and conventional value [...] they derive from the law, is a fact, which admits, I conceive, of no denial. Value of this description may be made to answer all the purposes of intrinsic value and supersede even the necessity for a standard, provided only the quantity of [...] issues be kept under due limitation," (Fullarton, "Regulation of Currencies", 2. ed., London 1845, p. 21,)</P>
<P>S. 143, Note 85<BR>
"Money does wear and grow lighter by often telling over ... It is the denomination and currency of the money that man regard in bargaining, and not the quantity of silver ... 'Tis the publick authority upon the metal that makes it money." (N. Barbon, l.c.p. 29, 30, 25.)</P>
<P>S. 144, Nota 86<BR>

And I am assured that, in the careless and clumsy way they must be used by the slaves, anything lighter or less rude could not be furnished them with good economy, and that such tools as we constantly give our labourers, and find our profit in giving them, would not last out a day in a Virginia cornfield - much lighter and more free from stones though it be than ours. So, too, when I ask why mules are so universally substituted for horses on the farm, the first reason given, and confessedly the moat conclusive one, is that horses cannot bear the treatment that they always must get from the negroes; horses are always soon foundered or crippled by them, while mules will bear cudgelling, or lose a meal or two now and then, and not be materially injured, and they do not take cold or get sick, if neglected or overworked; But I do not need to go further than to the window of the room in which I am writing, to see at almost any time, treatment of cattle that would insure the immediate discharge of the driver by almost any farmer owning them in the North."

"In the early days of textile manufactures, the locality of the factory depended upon the existence of a stream having a sufficient fall to turn a water wheel; and, although the establishment of the water mills was the commencement of the breaking up of the domestic system of manufacture, yet the mills necessarily situated upon streams, and frequently at considerable distances the one from the other, formed part of a rural rather than an urban system; and it was not until the introduction of the steam-power as a substitute for the stream, that factories were congregated in towns and localities where the coal and water required for the production of steam were found in sufficient quantities. The steam-engine is the parent of manufacturing towns." (A. Redgrave in "Reports of the Insp. of Fact. 30th April 1860", p. 36.)</P>

Question: 'But in submitting he has accepted wages which are insufficient to support him, and looks to parochial contribution as the remainder of his support?' Answer: 'Yes, and in fact the competition between the hand-loom and the power-loom is maintained out of the poor-rates.'

"Mr. Ricardo, ingeniously enough, avoids a difficulty which, on a first view, threatens to encumber his doctrine, that value depends on the quantity of labour employed in production. If this principle is rigidly adhered to, it follows that the value of labour depends on the quantity of labour employed in producing it - which is evidently absurd. By a dexterous turn, therefore, Mr. Ricardo makes the value of labour depend on the quantity of labour required to produce wages; or, to give him the benefit of his own language, he maintains, that the value of labour is to be estimated by the quantity of labour required to produce wages; by which he means the quantity of labour required to produce the money or commodities given to the labourer.

Les imp&ocirc;ts directs, les corv&eacute;es, les servitudes de tout genre, &eacute;crasent le cultivateur allemand, qui paie encore des imp&ocirc;ts indirects dans tout ce qu'il ach&egrave;te ... et pour comble de ruine, il n'ose pas vendre ses productions o&ugrave; et comme il le veut; il n'ose pas acheter ce dont il a besoin aux marchands qui pourraient le lui livrer au meilleur prix. Toutes cas causes le ruinent insensiblement, et il se trouverait hors d'&eacute;tat de payer les imp&ocirc;ts directs &agrave; l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance sans la filerie; elle lui offre une ressource, en occupant utilement sa femme, ces enfants, ses servants, ses valets, et lui-m&ecirc;me: mais quelle p&eacute;nible vie, m&ecirc;me aid&eacute;e de ce secours! En &eacute;t&eacute;, il travaille comme un for&ccedil;at au labourage et &agrave; la r&eacute;colte; il se couche &agrave; 9 heures et se l&egrave;ve &agrave; deux, pour suffire aux travaux; en hiver il devrait r&eacute;parer ses forces par un plus grand repos; mais il manquera de grains pour le pain et les semailles, s'il se d&eacute;fait des denr&eacute;es qu'il faudrait vendre pour payer les imp&ocirc;ts. Il faut donc filer pour suppl&eacute;er &agrave; ce vide ... il faut y apporter la plus grande assiduit&eacute;. Aussi le paysan se couche-t-il en hiver &agrave; minuit, une heure, et se l&egrave;ve &agrave; cinq ou six; ou bien il se couche &agrave; neuf, et se l&egrave;ve &agrave; deux, et cela tous les jours de sa vie si ce n'est le dimanche. Cet exc&egrave;s de veille et de travail usent la nature humaine, et de l&agrave; vient qu'hommes et femmes vieillissent beaucoup plut&ocirc;t dans les campagnes que dans les villes." (Mirabeau, l.c., t. III, p. 212 sqq.)</P>

Knight: "You, my neighbour, the husbandman, you Maister Mercer, and you Goodman Copper, with other artificers, may save yourselves metely well. For as much as all things are deerer than they were, so much do you arise in the pryce of your wares and occupations that yee sell agayne. But we have nothing to sell where by we might advance ye pryce there of, to countervaile those things that we must buy agayne." ... "I pray you, what be those sorts that ye meane. And, first, of those that yee thinke should have no base hereby?" - Doktor: "I meane all these that live by buying and selling, for, as they buy deare, they sell thereafter." -Knight: "What is the next sorte that yee say would win by it?" - Doctor: "Marry, all such as have takings or fearmes in their owne manurance" (d.h. cultivation) "at the old rent, for where they pay after the olde rate, they sell after the newe - that is, they paye for their lande good cheape, and sell all things growing thereof deare ..." Knight: "What sorte is that which, ye sayde should have greater losse hereby, than these men had profit?" - Doctor: "It is all noblemen, gentlemen, and all other that live either by a stinted rent or stypend, or do not manure" (cultivate) "the ground, or doe occupy no buying and selling."

"Twenty pounds of wool converted unobtrusively into the yearly clothing of a labourer's family by its own industry in the intervals of other work - this makes no show; but bring it to market, send it to the factory, thence to the broker, thence to the dealer, and you will have great commercial operations, and nominal capital engaged to the amount of twenty times its value ... The working class is thus emerced to support a wretched factory population, a parasitical shopkeeping class, and a fictitious commercial, monetary and financial system."

"... Dans les colonies o&ugrave; l'esclavage a &eacute;t&eacute; aboli sans que le travail forc&eacute; se trouvait remplac&eacute; par une quantit&eacute; &eacute;quivalente de travail libre, on a vu s'op&eacute;rer la contrepartie du fait qui se r&eacute;alise tous les jours sous nos yeux. On a vu les simples travailleurs exploiter &agrave; leur tour les entrepreneurs d'industrie, exiger d'eux des salaires hors de toute proportion avec la part l&eacute;gitime qui leur revenait dans le produit. Les planteurs, ne pouvant obtenir de leurs sucres un prix suffisant pour couvrir la hausse de salaire, ont &eacute;t&eacute; oblig&eacute;s de fournir l'exc&eacute;dant, d'abord sur leurs profits, ensuite sur leurs capitaux m&ecirc;mes. Une foule de planteurs ont &eacute;t&eacute; ruin&eacute;s de la sorte, d'autres ont ferm&eacute; leurs ateliers pour &eacute;chapper &agrave; une ruine imminente ... Sans doute, il vaut mieux voir p&eacute;rir des accumulations de capitaux, que des g&eacute;n&eacute;rations d'hommes" (...)

"C'est, ajoutez-vous, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'appropriation du sol et des capitaux que l'homme, qui n'a que ses bras, trouve de l'occupation, et se fait un revenu ... c'est au contraire, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'appropriation individuelle du sol qu'il se trouve des homme n'ayant que leurs bras ... Quand vous mettez un homme dans le vide, vous vous emparez de l'atmosph&egrave;re. Ainsi faites-vous, quand vous vous emparez du sol ...
